While I do belive that steps should be taken to ensure that individuals are kept off the streets (but also left with more money than they can handle), it would be wise to strive for at least a small closing of the gap, in order to ensure that communism does not become a possibility. The governemtn should take steps to limit the amount of wealth that any one person can achieve, and should also take steps to open more homeless shelters and small businesses within the US to provide for those with nothing. If this were to be achieved, less people would be homeless and struggling, and more people would be kept from growing corrupted due to excessive and uncontrollable income.",1,0,0

I think our government should tax those that are at the very least in the top 1% a lot more. All of their wealth was made from our society, so it's time for them to give back to it. Some policies I saw proposed were rolling back the Bush era tax cuts, using the recent military budget increase to pay for free college tuition, and also rolling back the Trump tax cuts as well. These and many other policies would make it so poorer and middle class Americans can get a good education, not be burdened by crippling student loan debt for decades, and also not have to worry about how they will pay their medical bills or of going bankrupt because of them.

I also firmly believe that those that are the richest in our country should be taxed more, and those within the population that are surrounding the poverty line (less than 25,000 a year I would think) should pay less in taxes. I also think that university is a huge sign of priviledge and should be less expensive, as to give a better chance to those that do not have the sort of funds to pay for public college.

A3VA5BS033GXU0,304,0,NA,"I think that the US needs to fix their tax code such that there is more equality between amount of money paid and amount of money earned. Similarly, fines should reflect those values, such that lower income families are not crippled by their inability to pay fines. Overall, economic inequality is an issue in this country, but at the same time, I don't want people to be punished for earning more money, which is sometimes the case when entering a higher tax bracket. The US should be able to regulate what is considered properly earned clean money, and what is money that is obtained through other means. I am concerned for example how much tax is avoided when you donate money to a charity. While it is a good cause, the donators should not necessarily avoid paying an even larger amount of money from their taxes. Not to mention people donate to their own charities, and the money may just recirculate within the family. This type of behavior is almost corruption even if it is not against the law. For poorer people, the opposite is true. Money is spent like water already, and yet further fees pile up, and there is no end really in sight. One needs a certain amount of money or opportunity to make a chance which isn't always readily available. As such, I feel the aforementioned policies may help to alleviate some of the issues.",1,1,0
