The inequalitydocuments_handcode.csv is the main dataset containing the documents, hand-coded document classifications, and other metadata. [Needs updated with final codings 05/26.]

The project.Rmd at the moment simply loads some packages, reads the data, cleans them (i.e. makes some of the features the correct class), and preprocesses the documents to make a document-feature matrix for building a classifier. It then splits the document-feature matrix into training and test sets (~70/30) in a way that accounts for the different data sources (MTurk survey and lab experiment) as well as experimental conditions in the latter. [We'll talk about the best way to do this going forward 05/26.] Please forgive the coding inefficiencies--no need or bandwidth to make it super elegant at this point. Finally, there's some commented-out code for building preliminary classifiers.

The spearly_boggs_vwb.pdf is a bad draft of a seminar paper I wrote with the lab data (coauthor credited, all deficiencies mine). It's only included here in case you want more context about the original project, data, and/or experimental manipulation in particular; it's probably a much better resource for this than I am at this point.
